# Niki

Niki is an internal staff credit and loan management system designed to handle loans, scoring, and eligibility in a transparent and structured way.

The system is built from real operational needs in a small business environment and focuses on fairness, motivation, and financial responsibility.

---

## What Niki Does

Niki allows staff members to:

- View their current credit balance
- See loans they have taken and repayment status
- Check whether they are eligible for a new loan
- Request loans and track approval status
- See their total score and score breakdown per criteria

Managers can:

- Define scoring criteria and weights
- Control loan limits and repayment rules
- Review loan requests
- Monitor overall system balance and risk

## Core Principles

### Loans, not handouts  
Niki is based on loans that are repaid gradually from salary.

### Gamification for improvement  
A scoring system based on predefined criteria controls loan eligibility and limits.

### Fairness and transparency  
Scores, rules, and decisions are visible and applied consistently.

---

## Competition Model

Niki operates with a limited credit pool.  
When multiple staff members are eligible for loans, higher scores result in faster access to available credit.

This introduces controlled competition without arbitrary decision-making.

---

## Scoring System

Each staff member has a total score calculated from weighted criteria such as:

- Work performance and customer interaction
- Punctuality and attendance
- Experience and time spent in the organization
- Task completion and shift responsibilities
- Learning progress (e.g. reading, vocabulary, training)
- Discipline and presentation standards

Each criterion has:
- A weight
- A scoring range
- Optional caps and limits

---

## Loan Rules

- Loan eligibility depends on total score
- Loan limits scale with score
- Repayment is done automatically through salary deductions
- Installments are small and interest-free
- Outstanding loans affect future eligibility

---

## Intended Users

- Small businesses
- Restaurants and service teams
- Organizations that want structured internal credit systems
- Teams where motivation and fairness matter more than punishment

---

## Tech Direction (Planned)

- Backend-first design
- Clear domain separation (users, scores, loans, payments)
- Role-based access (staff vs manager)
- API-driven architecture
- Audit-friendly data model

The project is intentionally designed to be simple, explicit, and extensible.

## Status

🚧 In progress  
This repository currently focuses on system design, data modeling, and API planning.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Niki is built from direct experience managing real teams and real constraints.  
The goal is not automation for its own sake, but creating a system that is predictable, understandable, and fair.
